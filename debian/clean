# remove directories created for packages of specific architectures
#
# Paths ending in a slash are directories to be removed,
# but the version of dh_clean in jessie tries to remove them,
# with a "rm -f" rather then -rf, which fails.
# So they are removed in the clean target of debian/rules instead
# and commented here for posterity
