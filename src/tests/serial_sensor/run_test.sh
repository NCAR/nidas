# Previously, this script scanned for "opening $TEST/testN" messages in the
# dsm.log to know when it was safe to signal the simulators to continue.
# However, the "opening" message is actually logged before the open() attempt,
# so there was a race condition between when the simulator started writing to
# the pty and when the dsm opened it.  This is now synchronized by using a new
# -H option to sensor_sim, so sensor_sim does not continue until the HUP is
# cleared, meaning the dsm has opened it's port.

# This synchronization ensures that the DSM does not write the sonic data mode
# prompts until sensor_sim is ready to read them, and sensor_sim does not
# start writing data messages until dsm is ready to read them.

# Since sensor_sim exits when it is done writing data, that is enough to
# synchronize when the dsm should be stopped.  Previously this script scanned
# for "closed" messages for each of the ports, but that could cause confusion
# when a sensor was closed because sensor_sim was not responding soon enough
# (ie, a sonic was not answering to data mode prompts and not reporting data).
# (It would be hard to guarantee that sensor_sim can respond like a hardware
# sensor, since it is subject to the process scheduler just like dsm.)

# It is safe to wait on the sensor_sim processes to finish, because they are
# guaranteed to exit on the alarm timeout.

# There is also no way to guarantee that all the sensors will even be opened
# at the same time.  It is possible (and has been observed) that some of the
# sensor_sim processes finish before the other ports have been opened.  Since
# port opens are handled by a different dsm thread and not synchronized in any
# way, the ordering depends entirely on the scheduler.  To synchronize the
# simulated sensors with each other, so their data are interleaved in the dsm
# reads, the sensor_sim processes would have to be synchronized somehow, such
# as by all running in one process.
