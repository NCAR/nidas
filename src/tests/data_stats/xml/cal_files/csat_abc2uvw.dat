# CSAT3 array geometry matrix for ABC->UVW transformations, by row.
# The standard values are:  -1.333 0.667 0.667 0.0 1.155 -1.155 0.385 0.385 0.385
#
# The following geometry of this CSAT3 was measured at the
# factory and provided to us by Campbell Scientific Inc.
# The geometry of each CSAT3 is stored in its firmware,
# and is used by the processing within the CSAT3 in the calculation of 3D winds.
# Campbell has provided these values so that we can apply a customized
# correction for transducer shadowing.
