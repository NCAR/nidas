    Digital I/O Cards.

/*
 * Each board has 10 16-bit counters and gobs of digital I/O pins.
 *
 * The implementation of a frequency counter uses 3 counters.
 * One counter on a board is used as a general timer clock.
 * Other driver modules can register with this clock to be
 * called back at periodic times.
 *
 * Therefore each board supports up to 3 frequency input
 * devices, or 9 pulse counters.
 *
 * Eventually the driver could also support a digital device,
 * for controlling all the I/O pins. Dig I/O interrupt
 * support is also available.
 *
 * So the following devices can be opened concurrently on a board:
 * 3 frequency counters, 1 dio
 * 2 frequency counters, 3 pulse counters, 1 dio
 * 1 frequency counters, 6 pulse counters, 1 dio
 * 0 frequency counters, 9 pulse counters, 1 dio
 *
 * Support for the pulse counters, dio and events has not been added yet....
 *
 * Board #0: Device table:
 * device        devname                minor number
 * freq cntr 0:  /dev/gpiomm_fcntr0     0
