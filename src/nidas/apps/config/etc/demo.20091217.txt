demo/meeting notes 20091217 (jja)

"channel" -> card / port / board

Add Sensor dialog: "Channel/Board"

Analog sensor
 - change cal coeff (eng/ins cals)
 - chg address
 - filter type: add pickoff/boxcar w/sample rate?
     (or just standardize - has always been boxcar)
     => samp rate 10 (min) / 100 (normal) / 500 (hirate)

ADD DSM

make clear which project this is (fr XML <project> not just filename)

when to "Save" vs. "Save As"
 - simple edits that update
 - moving vars around that might break other processing
 => warn user that they might want to Save As

multiple "default*.xml"
 - convention of latest #
 - need a more clear naming convention?
 => show dates for files in open
    allow sort by date or filename

when creating a new xml
 - copy old?
 - create new: have some skeleton
 - project init/setup? separate activity

sensors:
 - need a more complete sensor catalog than just this xml
 - certain sensors can only be in certain DSMs
 - S/N choices constrained by sensor type
 - device/chan constrained by DSM (e.g. radome no S1)
 - suffix constained by sensor type
 => extra config files?

separate cal file editor?
 - S/N match-up w/cal-file name
 - editors:
   default.xml/data acquisition
   A2D cal ed
   eng cal ed
   -> some cal ed allowable in default.xml (pitch)
 => config ed's cal fields should indicate if cals are from XML or calfile
   (and editing goes local or opens calfile ed)
   
different Add Sensor dialog (or elements of box) for diff sensor types
  UDP,serial,analog,PMS

edit the cells
  e.g. quickly change channel
  => "Other" chan edits linked from/to device cell

HIPPO-2 inet:: bug in Add Sensor channel

tree view of sensor w/color-coded sensor type
or tabs under DSM for each sensor type

for beta:
 +DSM
 specify var name
 +Analog channels ("vars")

save backups to backups/default%d.xml
 => svn/git integration?


======
cjw:

-Analog
 - add cals
 - sample rate, drop down not type in
-Dialog has channel # for analog card, change to card #
-SPP probes missing from ADELE?
-Serial numbers same as probe location?
 drop downs of pre-existing
-No editing of cals

Instr base types
 Analog
 Serial dev#, sfx
 PMS <-> dev
 UDP port#, sfx

Chris, nimbus /SS merge
- cals & eng cal files
- serial nums
