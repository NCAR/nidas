Document::addSensor()
 add calls to:
   dsmConfig->getSite()->validateVariables()

1. adding a sensor: [***FOR DEMO***]
 constrain device and sensor ID
  - fix channel min/max unsigned/signed int stuff
  - set chan and dev on initial setup of widget
  - fill out setDevice slot

2. add analog sensor [***FOR DEMO ???***]

3. investigate Qt's model/view business for table displays

4. delete a sensor

5. What about Fast2DC device?  /dev/usbtwod_64_ or /dev/usbtwod
   - or more generally, a sensor that doesn't have a simple mapping?

6.  What about sensors that don't appear in our current map?  Default? or warn user and tell them to   
    get help?  Or give a chance to type free text and provide range?
