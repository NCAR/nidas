1. add analog sensor [***FOR DEMO ???***]

2. investigate Qt's model/view business for table displays

3. delete a sensor

4. What about Fast2DC device?  /dev/usbtwod_64_ or /dev/usbtwod
   - or more generally, a sensor that doesn't have a simple mapping?

5.  What about sensors that don't appear in our current map?  Default? or warn user and tell them to   
    get help?  Or give a chance to type free text and provide range?
