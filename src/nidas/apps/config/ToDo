for maclean:
 Multiple sites can have same attributes.  When parsing if we have same site name, class, number and suffix then
   abandon all hope ye who enter.
   -  Consider change of nidas to require some sort of uniqueness check on name? name and class?
   - xml requires name,class and optional number,suffix ; nidas code does no checks

0.5 For Merge of config branch back into trunck   [work with maclean on this one]
-    #ifndef NIDAS_EmBEDDED to avoid compilation for arm/armbe situations - put this around source code
   so that scdons ... or better yet 0- SConscript
nidas.spec update for QT


*************************************

0.60 Ability to Edit NidasItems - 
  - Status: still need to be able to edit variable names, sample rate for serial devices
  - Also, currently change of dsm, sensor ids is not validated against existing
     ids.  fromDOMElement for these doesn't make that check - need to do a check
     at a higher level.  To my surprise, site->validate() didn't catch it either.
0.601 Variable calibrations - need to make use of .dat files for variable cals - the logic is somewhat interesting and need to think about it.  Will have both .dat calfile defined and xml cals defined when writing xml.  When reading xml if both are defined then need to ask user "pull from cal file?"... all this only if there is an .dat file matching the variable name - if not then just work w/xml.  If reading xml and find cals but no cal file name AND there is a cal file in existence we need to ask "use cal file? OR stick with current cals?"   ... may need to show what cal file values are in dialog... yes that's a  must.


0.61 - bugs:
  - Adding a2d on same board number seems to be affecting existing a2d 
  - on suffix allow them to enter or not enter underscore and just make sure one is there in the end
  - name that shows up on main window is configview - needs to be configedit
  - appears that when we edit a dsm id we can make it the same as another dsm id, not so when adding.
0.62 Need to be able to add items when parent selected, not just when siblings are.

0.620 - from presentation
  - can we have a "catalog" of all prior analog devices 
  - Paro scientific is ill-defined in  catalog
  - would like a viewer capability in general - view on plane, edit in lab
  - right click capability vs. the dropdown menus
  - serial variables need editing capability - cal coefs and names 
  - serial numbers  for devices and for analog cards.
  - color coordination variable from catalog in one color, from project xml in another

0.63 Pavel request - selection on treeview should show children on tableview (industry standard?)
0.64 Edit items - just pop up the add dialog with fields filled in and on accept delete from models and add back in.
0.65 Need to be able to edit non-a2d variable names, but only their names. 
0.66 editor is adding blank lines to xml around comments - remove those extra blank lines on save.
 

0.67 Document class is overblown mess.  Work on design so that it can be minimized if not eliminated.  Can NidasItems have an addChild method 
that given information from the GUI can do the work that Document class is currently doing?

0.68 Specialty dsm = CVI dsm would have all CVI elements and then add instruments to follow.

0.7 - inventory - available serial numbers - available device names - 
  - in the SensorCatalog?  or inventory files
* Serial Number
* device template
PMSSpecs

When adding an A2D variable, if it doesn't start with an X check to see if exists in the variable database and if not 
warn that it doesn't and are they ok with it (might consider adding an X for experimental).

xerces include capability  - would facilitate separate catalog - latest xerces offer this?
 - getting catalog separate xml file and #including it into 
 - copied from master direcotry to the project into the project directory and used from there (so we keep project catalog over long haul).  
     * So config edit would look first in proj dir, if not there then pull copy from master dir and then use it.

chris has been working on merging - pmsspecs, depends, etc into a netCDF header
- look there for keys for the configuration editor.

VARDB is binary - units and titles - binary don't edit

Nimbus:
 - VarDB - units and Title and catagory and standard name = vared  ./VarDB room for valid_range cF convention
 - DependTable - give dependancies of variables
 - Cals - handed to nimbus from  nidas
 - Defaults - all kinds of weird calibration information - specific to folks/instruments.
 *- PMSspecs - inventory file - key value START/END based on serial number  ***** Use this as inventory!! ******
 *- nimbus has a library api for getting at the list of serial numbers for PMSSpec
    ) libraf and libraf++ - pmsspec class
    ) /opt/local/lib link
  - note: cell size information etc found in cdp.default

Aircraft specs funtion in libraf++ - double check it dives into vardb file correctly.
 - consider functionality that we want to keep gets migrated into nidas - put into dynld/raf ?

Only thing left out is probe locations for canisters - could put it into lib aircraft inventory

Suffix is can location


1.0.5 consider using an actionHelper class to mediate between Qt/ConfigWindow and NidasItem
//parentItem->setupyouractions(ahelper);
  //ActionHelper {
  // disableAllActions()
  // addSensor(bool)
  // addDSM(bool)
  // ...
  //ahelper->addSensor(true);


1.1 full code review for efficiency, memory leaks, separation of concerns
       get business model and logic out of configWindow as much as possible;
       configWindow should just know about Qt windows & apps
       is configwindow the controller?  Or should it be Document?

       add throw clause to all method declarations;
       generally review exception handling

       doxygenate everything

2. What about Fast2DC device?  /dev/usbtwod_64_ or /dev/usbtwod
   - or more generally, a sensor that doesn't have a simple mapping?

3.  What about sensors that don't appear in our current map?  Default? or warn user and tell them to   
    get help?  Or give a chance to type free text and provide range?
    - increase <sensorCatalog> to all-known sensors?
    - get a sensorCatalog from elsewhere (another config file?)?
    - templates for c130,gv,...

4. Investigate efficiencies of DSMDisplayWidget::getDSMNode - better way to find site and dsm?
   - Can nidas fromDOMs insert pointers to itself into the DOM tree using setUserData?

5. demo bits:
add sensor dialog : sensor-based labels/constraints
sample rate: drop down 10/100/500

6 (from Pavel)
.1 Listing tree contents on the right (e.g. when DSM is selected then sensors are on the right) is better form.
.2 Would be great to borrow configurations from previous projects - i.e. open up old project and copy/past a sensor from it to current project.
.3 edit sensor catalog?  e.g. move variable from NOAA UCATS to NOAA PANTHER.

99. notes

for editing, consider:

 find the DOMNode/DOMElement to be edited
 DOMNode::cloneNode(true) to get a full recursive copy
 edit the copy
 validate xml somehow
   if bad, quit/error
 find nidas object
 remove it from parent (so it doesn't interfere with fromDOM/validation)
 to get a new nidas object
   use nidas parent CHILDTYPEfromDOMElement()
   (or maybe the CHILDTYPE's own fromDOM)
 perform any extra nidas validation logic
 if new nidas is good (no exceptions) then
   add it to parent
   delete old nidas obj
   add new DOMNode into DOM (if not already there from validation)
   (recursively) delete old DOMNode
 else
   delete new nidas obj
   delete new DOMNode
   quit/error




999. feb02
 attempt a basic QHeaderView to play with / try to resolve tree/table header funniness
   FAIL QHeaderView are just QAbstractItemView's tied to the same model,
        using model's headerDataChanged signal and reading the header data
        from model's same headerData()
        -tried changing header views during setRootIndex() but with the same
         model, this was fruitless; introducing a new model was futile chasing
         of rabbits down holes through the Qt-glass
    idea: change model to have all possible nidas attributes as columns
       and hide/show headerView (and TableView) columns based on place in model
       - makes for a less "realistic" model
       - hide/show columns perhaps should be done with a QSortFilterProxyModel
         and it's filterAcceptsColumn()


 wire add/delete sensor into new model/views

9999. Nidas ToDo:
  const/non-const iterators

  DSMSensor base class should define a method/api for parameters
    how many params, their names, required/optional,...
    subclasses (actual sensor implementations) override for their particular params
     -all nidas things that have xml <parameters> should do this
      means they should also inherit something like ParameterDefinition class with this api
     -also maybe more exception subclasses needed e.g. MissingParameterException ?

999999.  Reimplement tabbed view?
   TabbedTablesQView
     ttqv->setSelection(tree->getSelection())

for maclean:
 do something about this bit from configwindow.cc
            // XXX *** XXX
            // very bad casting of const to non-const to get a mutable pointer to our dsm
            // *** NEEDS TO BE FIXED either here or in nidas::core
            //
            DSMConfig * dsm = (DSMConfig*)(di.next());
 => Site::getDSMConfigIterator() returns a const iterator and is only way to get an individual DSMConfig,
    which we need non-const to later add/delete/edit sensors etc
