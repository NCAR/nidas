Branch changes for DSMConfig::DeviceUnique [done in branch; maclean in trunk]

1. from demo:
add project label
sensor type tabs under a dsm or other views to increase # of visible sensors

2. investigate Qt's model/view business for table displays

3. What about Fast2DC device?  /dev/usbtwod_64_ or /dev/usbtwod
   - or more generally, a sensor that doesn't have a simple mapping?

4.  What about sensors that don't appear in our current map?  Default? or warn user and tell them to   
    get help?  Or give a chance to type free text and provide range?
    - increase <sensorCatalog> to all-known sensors?
    - get a sensorCatalog from elsewhere (another config file?)?
    - templates for c130,gv,...

5. Multiple sites can have same attributes.  When parsing if we have same site name, class, number and suffix then
   abandon all hope ye who enter.
   -  Consider change of nidas to require some sort of uniqueness check on name? name and class?

6. Investigate efficiencies of DSMDisplayWidget::getDSMNode - better way to find site and dsm?
   - Can nidas fromDOMs insert pointers to itself into the DOM tree using setUserData?

7. demo bits:
add sensor dialog : sensor-based labels/constraints
sample rate: drop down 10/100/500
for beta: add dsm, specify var name, add analog vars
