# On aircraft, DSMs are booted before each flight, and
# that is a good time to rotate the logs and do other routine
# system stuff, rather than in /etc/cron.{hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}.
# In the postinst script of ads-daq, if DISABLE_CRONS is true (the default),
# then the execution of the /etc/cron.* scripts is disabled in /etc/crontab,
# and they are executed instead in /etc/rc.local. For lab DSMs with the
# ads-daq package installed, which aren't routinely rebooted, uncomment this
# and set to false to enable the cron.* scripts in /etc/crontab.
